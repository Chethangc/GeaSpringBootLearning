Please:
1 Check that MySQL is running on address mysql8-host

3 Check the user chethangc has rights to connect to mysql8-host from your address (MySQL rights define what clients can connect to the server and from which machines) 
4 Make sure you are both providing a password if needed and using the correct password for mysql8-host connecting from the host address you're connecting from
